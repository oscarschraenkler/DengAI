# Predicting Dengue Fever outbreaks using environmental variables

- Description: Using environmental data collected by various U.S. Federal Government agencies—from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the U.S. Department of Commerce— can we predict the number of dengue fever cases reported each week in San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos, Peru?

## Problem Statement
Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease that occurs in tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world. In mild cases, symptoms are similar to the flu: fever, rash, and muscle and joint pain. In severe cases, dengue fever can cause severe bleeding, low blood pressure, and even death. Because it is carried by mosquitoes, the transmission dynamics of dengue are related to climate variables such as temperature and precipitation.

Our task is to predict the number of dengue cases each week in San Juan and Iquitos based on environmental variables describing changes in temperature, precipitation, vegetation, and more.

An understanding of the relationship between climate and dengue dynamics could improve research initiatives and resource allocation to help fight life-threatening pandemics.
